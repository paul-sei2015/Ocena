Programming standards
   File names
      Separate words in file names with a dash
      
   Classes
      Put each new class into a separate file, with the file named the same as the class (but using the file name protocol, eg user-services.php)
      Class names
         Camel case each class name, beginning with a capital letter, eg UserServices
      
   Function names
      Camel case each function name, beginning with a lower case letter, eg userLogin
      Begin any protected functions with an underscore
      
   Variable names
      User underscores to separate words in a variable, eg user_id
      Begin protected variables with an underscore, eg _password
         Protect all information specific to a class, eg passwords, user_id, etc
   
   Documentation
      Leave a comment at the beginning of each class and function
         There is no need to comment a variable unless it has a confusing name
      Document chunks of code for clarity
      If deleting a chunk of code, comment it out and double check with whoever wrote it before actually removing it
      
   Spacing
      Spaces for tabs, 3 spaces
      Indent all functions once in the functions.php file (excluding the include_once and ev_include functions)
      Do not indent the class name in a class file
      Leave one blank line after each function or class
         Space out large chunks of code within a function
